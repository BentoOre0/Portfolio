## Fobisia Codify Hackathon Project: Second-Hand Uniform Organizing System ðŸŽ“ðŸ‘•

### Overview
Our team participated in the Fobisia Codify Hackathon with the aim of developing an innovative solution for organizing second-hand uniforms within our school's uniform shop. Despite being disqualified due to a late submission, the project showcased our skills in Java application development and database management.

### Project Details
- **Idea:** To create an efficient organizing system using Java Swing for the user interface.
- **Contributions:** I primarily developed the backend functionalities including `Home.java` and `Orders.java`.
- **Technology Stack:** Utilized Java Swing for the frontend and incorporated local database storage with SQL interactions for data management.

### Key Features
1. **User Interface (UI) Development:** Designed and implemented UI components using Java Swing to ensure a user-friendly experience.
2. **Backend Logic:** Implemented crucial backend functionalities such as managing orders and maintaining inventory records.
3. **Database Integration:** Used SQL to interact with a local database, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval for uniform records.

### Achievements and Learnings
- **Technical Skills:** Strengthened proficiency in Java programming, particularly in GUI development with Java Swing.
- **Database Management:** Gained practical experience in integrating SQL databases within Java applications.
- **Collaboration:** Worked effectively within a team environment, contributing to the project's backend development and problem-solving.
