# GravSim
A 2D **N-body gravity simulator** written in Python using **Pygame**. The simulator models gravitational interactions between celestial bodies while accelerating force computation using the **Barnes-Hut algorithm** and a dynamically constructed **quadtree**.

## Context

The Barnes-Hut algorithm decides whether a group of bodies can be approximated as a single mass using the criterion `s / d < θ`, where:

- `s` is the width of the quadtree node.
- `d` is the distance from the current body to the node's center of mass.
- `θ` is a user-defined accuracy threshold.

If `s / d < θ`, the node is sufficiently far away relative to its size, so its entire mass is approximated by its center of mass. Otherwise, the node is recursively subdivided and its children are evaluated individually.

**Smaller values of `θ` produce higher accuracy at the cost of more computations, while larger values improve performance by allowing more approximations.**

## Features

* Barnes-Hut approximation for efficient gravitational force computation
* Dynamic quadtree spatial partitioning
* Interactive body creation and orbital spawning
* Collision detection with momentum-conserving body merging
* Real-time quadtree rendering

## Implementation

Each simulation step:

1. Construct a quadtree over all bodies.
2. Compute the center of mass for each node.
3. Traverse the tree using the Barnes-Hut criterion (`s / d < θ`) to approximate distant regions.

Gravity is computed using Newton's law (`F = Gm₁m₂ / r²`), while collisions merge bodies by conserving linear momentum (`m₁v₁ + m₂v₂ = (m₁ + m₂)v_f`).
