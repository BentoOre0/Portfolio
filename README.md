## 👋 Introduction
Hi! I'm **Jeremy Aidan Hernandez Yu**, a passionate coder and problem solver. I have a diverse background in data analysis, algorithm optimization, and competitive programming.

## 🏆 Achievements
- **Project 1: Timed Sorts**
  - A python library which allows you to see the impacts of complexity and memory of different sorting algorithms.
- **Project 2: Fobisia Codify Draft**
  - A draft submission for the first hackathon i joined. Final copy has been lost :( with my team.
- **Project 3: Automated Color Analysis** 
  - Developed a data analysis tool using clustering algorithms to measure the oxidization level of bananas.
  - This project was featured in a research paper and won a in school competition.
- **Project 4: 2D Gravity Simulation for PyCharm**
  - Optimized the algorithm from O(n^2) to O(n log n) using the Barnes Hut approximation.
- **Project 5: API protocols with Type Script**
  - This is what I did with my days shadowing with Price Locq. I will update this in the future with bigger projects.
