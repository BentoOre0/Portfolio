# üåü Jeremy Aidan Hernandez Yu - GitHub Portfolio

## üëã Introduction
Hi! I'm **Jeremy Aidan Hernandez Yu**, a passionate coder and problem solver. I have a diverse background in data analysis, algorithm optimization, and competitive programming.

## üèÜ Achievements in order of completion
- **Project 1: Timed Sorts**
  - A python library which allows you to see the impacts of complexity and memory of different sorting algorithms. Literally times sorts
- **Project 2: Fobisia Codify Draft**
  - A draft submission for the first hackathon i joined. Final copy has been lost :( with my team.
- **Project 3: Automated Color Analysis** 
  - Developed a data analysis tool using clustering algorithms to measure the oxidization level of bananas.
  - This project was featured in a research paper and won a in school competition.
- **Project 4: 2D Gravity Simulation for PyCharm**
  - Optimized the algorithm from O(n^2) to O(n log n) using the Barnes Hut approximation.
- **Project 5: Computer Science Extended Essay Research Project (imageplayground)**:
  - Investigated "How do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) compare against Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) in recognising the Baybayin script under varying degrees of rotation, noise intensities and no added distortions?"
  - See paper on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tz5_n4KKLvXJk2pD9c-VNwKGnvGy7cFN/view?usp=sharing)
- **Project 6: Part time work with [LOCQ/SEAGAS](https://new.pricelocq.com/) Development Team - LOCQMorerecentwork**
  - Developed a dispatching and fulfillment control system for delivery operations using Node and Nest Js
  - Integrated the Viber API for automated rider messaging and order confirmations.
  - Built a minimum viable product (MVP) using Google Apps Script + Google Sheets (no external DB yet) and easier to use for ground staff for now 
  - Deployed components to AWS serverless infrastructure for scalability.
  - Gained hands-on experience with version control workflows and collaborative deployment.
  - Currently planning to use graph algorithms for optimal rider assignment for a phase 2
## üåê Competitive Programming
- Regular participant in Informatics Olympiads.
- Top 20+ placer in the Philippine National Olympiad in Informatics ([NOI.ph](https://noi.ph)), best position: 4th place.
- Invited to the Asia Pacific International Olympiad for two consecutive years.
- IOI team selection & National Team in 2023,2024 and 2025
- 1 rank off IOI 2024 team
- Founded a Competitive Programmin Club in School 20+ members. Host in house contests every 2 weeks for snacks!

## üìö Education
- IB student who took physics, chem and math HL
- Studying Applied Sciences @ UBC
- Completely self-taught developer: Most comfortable with python/JS for development, out of practice with Java, C++ for competitve programming

## üìà Recent Developments
- Leveraging recent AI advancements to enhance my development process.
- Bought a Raspberry Pi and began tinkering after IB exams

## üéØ Goals
- Learn hardware and electronics! (Most excited for someting new!)
- Continue to excel in competitive programming and algorithm development.
- Explore more advanced topics in AI and machine learning, espescially with logistics optimisation
